# Built-in (aka out-of-the-box) objects

The ClickTwice libraries are shipped with a few must-have and basic handlers and other types to cover common scenarios without duplication. They are:

- `PublishPageHandler` (`IOutputHandler`) - This handler is a drop-in replacement for the old "Install" page generated by Visual Studio. It also serves as a reference implementation of an output handler.
- `InstallPageHandler` (`IOutputHandler`) - This handler is intended as a more capable and up-to-date launch and install page, built as a single-file template with full HTML5/JS/CSS3 support.
- `AppInfoHandler` (`IInputHandler` and `IOutputHandler`) - Handler for parsing, updating and publishing application information in an `app.info` file.
- `AppDetailsPageHandler` (`IOutputHandler`) - Included with the ScriptCs and Cake hosts, this handler can generate pages or whole sites from Razor templates using a model derived from the ClickTwice manifest and an `app.info` file. Not included with the Core package.
- `BuildConfigurator` (`IBuildConfigurator`) - Base type for custom build configurators to implement.
